  4. To see the page locally:
     1. Run `npm start`
  5. To review all of the tests run `npm test`.

### User Experience:
  1. User should be able to view a gallery view of movies 
  2. When the user clicks on a movie they should be able to view the individual movie specs
    - Each movie should have a: Title, Poster image, description, rating, genre, budget, revenue, film duration.
  3. User should be able to use the tomatillo icon or the page title to return home
