# Overlook Hotel Solo Project
## Project Description:
[This is a hotel booking application](https://jaypeasee.github.io/overlook-hotel/). 


## Setup Instructions:
  1. `Fork` [this repository](https://github.com/jaypeasee/rancid-tomatillos).
  2. `Clone` it down to your local machine in the Terminal with the command `git clone <your ssh key>`. 
  3. Run `npm install` to get Webpack to compile the various implementation files.
  4. To see the page locally:
     1. Run `npm start`

  5. To review all of the tests run `npm test`.

### User Experience:



## Learning Goals:
1. Work with APIs to receive and send data that dictate content on the page.
2. Create a robust testing suite that drives the `OOP` process.
3. Use `event delegation` to control almost the entirety of `DOM` manipulation.
4. Use tools within `scss` to separate and `DRY` up stylesheets.
5. Use `media queries` to make a fully responsive page.





## Programming Languages and Technology Used:
* `JavaScript` using `ES6` functions and classes.
* `HTML`
* `SCSS`
* `Webpack` to bundle all necessary implementation files.
* `NPM` to run the page locally, test classes and objects, lint each line of code, and to utilize the `moment` time package.
* `React`
